# oldb-mensa-py

Webscraping application for getting todays menu at 'Mensa Uhlhornsweg' at Carl-von-Ossietzky Universit√§t Oldenburg. 


## TBD:
  - sometimes, if the main dish has a long name the second line is dropped: include it
  - differentiate between Ausgabe Eins, Zwei, Drei and Culinarium
  - format the output in .json
  - make sure that Siri can access the output through a shortcut
